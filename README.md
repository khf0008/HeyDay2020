# HeyDay2020
Housing Krista Fincke's Hey Day script

### What is Hey Day?
Hey Day is an Auburn University tradition that began in the 1940's. According to the [Auburn University website] (http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/) Hey Day serves as a means to bring all of the Auburn family together. The tradition goes that name tags are distributed, and students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to simply greet each other with a "hey!" followed by the person's name. Even in the time of COVID-19, Auburn is continuing the tradition in a virtual setting!

The script emulates a Hey Day interaction by simply asking the user for their name, then greeting them in the appropriate Hey Day manner. I hope you enjoy!
